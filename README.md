# SignatureKinematics
This repository hosts the weights of a neural network model designed to estimate kinematic and dynamic features from online signature trajectories. The model leverages a multilayer perceptron to predict the angular positions, angular velocities, and force torques typically associated with a UR5e robotic arm's signing motions.
